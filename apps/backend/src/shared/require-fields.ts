 * Rejects a malformed request body AT THE EDGE, before any cross-context lookup
 * runs. Without it an absent id flows straight into Prisma (findById(undefined))
 * and surfaces as an opaque 500/UNKNOWN_ERROR instead of the 400 the client can
 * actually act on. Throws the ValidationError LIST that the
 * DomainExceptionFilter already understands (same shape as
 * Validator.combineErrors), so every missing field is reported at once.
 *
 * This is a presence check only — the real rules stay in the value objects and
 * entities that own them.
