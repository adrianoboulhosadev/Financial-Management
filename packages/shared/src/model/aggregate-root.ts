/**
 * An Entity that also records DOMAIN EVENTS as its own mutator methods change
 * its state — the event is raised right where the transition happens (e.g.
 * `Payment.confirm()` records `DepositConfirmed`), not re-derived later by
 * diffing before/after state.
 *
 * `pullDomainEvents` drains AND clears the list — a use case calls it exactly
 * once per execution, right after persisting, so nothing is ever published
 * twice. The list is never part of `props`, so `clone`/reconstitution from a
 * database row always starts empty: only a transition that happens DURING the
 * current execution ever produces an event, never the act of reading a row.
